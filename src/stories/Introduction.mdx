# ðŸ¦‹ Mayu UI
 
An extensively themable component library for Svelte. 

> This project is still work in progress and not production ready. Breaking changes may appear with any release.

We want to deliver a great component library that can be simply styled by an extensive theming system.
Creating your own theme will be very simple with the provided Themebuilder.

It's built on top of [Melt-UI](https://melt-ui.com/), the great headless-ui library for Svelte.
