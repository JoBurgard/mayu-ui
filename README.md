# ðŸ¦‹ Mayu UI

An extensively themable component library for Svelte. 

> [!WARNING]

We want to deliver a great component library that can be simply styled by an extensive theming system.
Creating your own theme will be very simple with the provided Themebuilder.

It's built on top of [Melt-UI](https://melt-ui.com/), the great headless-ui library for Svelte.

## How to use it

### 1. Modify your uno.config.ts

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  presets: [presetWind(), presetIcons()],
  transformers: [transformerDirectives(), transformerVariantGroup()],
  content: {
    pipeline: {
      include: [
        // ...
        // add this line
        'node_modules/mayu-ui/dist/**/*.{svelte,js}',
      ],
    },
    // if you use unocss classes in your app.html
    filesystem: ['src/app.html'],
  },
});
```

### 2. Create a theme.css file

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.d.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme.css <--- this
```

Fill it with your theme from the Themebuilder.

### 3. Import the needed css files

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script>
  import '@unocss/reset/tailwind.css';
  import '../theme.css';
  import 'virtual:uno.css';
</script>
```

### 4. Use the components

```svelte
<script>
  import { buttonVariants, Input } from 'mayu-ui';
</script>

<Input type="text" />
<button class={buttonVariants()}>Click me</button>
```
